A collection is a logical grouping of Markdown content. Collections are located within the 'project/resources/collections' directory. 
Dagger interprets each directory here as an individual collection. The frontmatter from a collection's files are made available by 
iterating over the collections name(the directory name) within a template. Collection files are also compiled and written out to the 
file system just like [page](/guides/pages/index.html) files.

A collection file located at 'project/resources/collections/guides/pages.md' will end up at 'project/site/guides/pages/index.html'. 
Dagger projects are intended to be served at the 'project/site' directory, so this file will be accessible at 'domain.com/guides/pages'.

It is essential that Markdown collection files include a 'template' key that specifies the name, not including the file extension, of the 
template file that the body of this collection file will be injected into to create a full HTML document.

To see an example of iterating over a collection and accessing the frontmatter within, refer to the 'project/resources/collections' directory 
of the example site that is generated by creating a new Dagger project. It contains a 'guides' collection with three files. The template file 
located at 'project/resources/pages/index.hbs' iterates over this collection and generates a list of items.

As mentioned earlier, iterating over the contents of a collection gets you access to all frontmatter established at the top of each file, but 
it is important to know that Dagger also makes a {{ path }} key available for user in your templates that will always map to the location of the
document that is currently in scope.
