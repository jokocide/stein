# ðŸ—¡ Dagger
Dagger is a static site generator built on .NET.

~~> This project is currently under construction, but look for Dagger on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) soon!~~
> Dagger has been released and is in a functional state, but improvements are coming soon. https://www.nuget.org/packages/Jokocide.Dagger/

To start using Dagger, you'll need to have the [**.NET SDK**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.

The .NET SDK is a set of libraries and tools that allow developers to create and use .NET applications and libraries:

- The .NET CLI.
- .NET libraries and runtime.
- The dotnet driver - *used to install tools like Dagger!*

If you aren't familiar with the ecosystem, .NET can install and run command-line tools just as you would with NPM on the Node.js side. 

With the .NET SDK installed, go ahead and install Dagger:

`dotnet tool install Jokocide.Dagger -g`

Dagger should now be available. Call it from anywhere with the `dagger` command, and view help with `dagger help`.

## New project

`dagger new` creates a new Dagger project in the current directory, which consists of a **resources** and **site** folder, as well as a hidden .dagger file that is used to identify Dagger projects in the future.

The **resources** folder should contain all of your content. When Dagger is finished processing the contents it will deposit the results into the **site** folder in a largely similiar file structure.

## Building your site

After you've gone through the **resources** folder and replaced it with your own content, run `dagger build` while in the project directory to generate the site.
