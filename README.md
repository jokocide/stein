# ðŸ—¡ Dagger

Dagger is a static site generator built with C# & .NET

~~> This project is currently under construction, but look for Dagger on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) soon!~~

> Dagger has been released! improvements are coming soon! https://www.nuget.org/packages/Jokocide.Dagger/

To start using Dagger, you'll need to have the [**.NET SDK**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.

The .NET SDK is a set of libraries and tools that allow developers to create and use .NET applications and libraries:

- The .NET CLI.
- .NET libraries and runtime.
- The dotnet driver - *used to install tools like Dagger!*

If you aren't familiar with the ecosystem, .NET can install and run command-line tools just as you would with NPM on the Node.js side. 

With the .NET SDK installed, go ahead and install Dagger:

`dotnet tool install Jokocide.Dagger -g`

Dagger will now be available. Call it from anywhere with the `dagger` command.
