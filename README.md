To start using Stein, you'll need to have the [**.NET SDK**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.

The .NET SDK is a set of libraries and tools that allow developers to create and use .NET applications and libraries:

- The .NET CLI.

With the .NET SDK installed, go ahead and install Stein.

`dotnet tool install stein -g`
